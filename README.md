# Connect 4

Challenge a friend to disc-dropping fun with the classic game of Connect 4! Drop your red or yellow discs in the grid and be the first to get 4 in a row/column/diagonal to win. If your opponent is getting too close to 4 in a row, block them with your own disc!

This is a command line implementation of the [Connect 4 game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)!
